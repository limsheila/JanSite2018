            <h1>Professional Summary</h1>
            <p>
                I am a engineer who want to become a full stack developer.  I am currently employed and learning under a professional senior engineer.
                I am learning all the basic coding on my own as well as more complicated programming language such as anjular js.
                I hope to become as good as or even better than my senior.
